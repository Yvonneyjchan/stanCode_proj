These projects were completed based on standard courses in stanCode SC001, SC101 and algorithm.

Every project shows different coding skills.

SC001

1. Karel the Robot: for loop, while loop, if statement,comments and decompositions.
2. Function and Variable: data type, assign, parameters and return.
3. String Manipulation: input, print, concatenation, string methods and file reading.
4. Image Processing: reading image data and image processing.

SC101

5. Object Oriented: constructor, attribute, method, super club, sub class and import.
6. Data Structure: list, stack, queue, dict, tuple, priority queue, linkedlist, tree, data processing and web crawler.

Algorithm

7. Algorithm: recursion, DFS and BFS.
